    <h2>Things I find Interesting and The Reasons Why</h2>
    <div id="Paragraphs">

        <p>One of the coolest things I've enjoyed while getting older is learning about new things, ideas and skills. <br> When I find myself in a place I've never been doing things I've never expected, I cant help but feel very aware of my own time on this earth. <br> How short it might be and what else might possibly lie along the road ahead. You never know how these things might open doors for new opportunities. </p>

        <p>Lately, I've found myself really getting into rock climbing after being introduced to it by my ex girlfriend. <br> I've seen videos of people climbing before and have been <em>awestruck</em> by the feats of strength climbers perform and the beautiful places they go to that many people never get a chance to see <br> I was terrified the first time I tried it but was able to overcome my fears by faking bravado to make her proud in front of her friends. Since that first leap of faith, I've become addicted. <br> </p>

        <p>Looking back its easy to see the way that climbing has changed me:
            <ul>
               <li>Its made me me physically and mentally stronger</li> 
               <li>It's introduced me to like-minded friends</li>
               <li>It's brought me to places I never would have been to otherwise</li>
            </ul>
            
            Looking ahead now, I feel excited for the future knowing I will be a better person tom
