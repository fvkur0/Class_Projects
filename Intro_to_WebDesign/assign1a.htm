    <h2>Things I find Interesting and The Reasons Why</h2>
    <div id="Paragraphs">

        <p>One of the coolest things I've enjoyed while getting older is learning about new things, ideas and skills. <br> When I find myself in a place I've never been doing things I've never expected, I cant help but feel very aware of my own time on this earth. <br> How short it might be and what else might possibly lie along the road ahead. You never know how these things might open doors for new opportunities. </p>

        <p>Lately, I've found myself really getting into rock climbing after being introduced to it by my ex girlfriend. <br> I've seen videos of people climbing before and have been <em>awestruck</em> by the feats of strength climbers perform and the beautiful places they go to that many people never get a chance to see <br> I was terrified the first time I tried it but was able to overcome my fears by faking bravado to make her proud in front of her friends. Since that first leap of faith, I've become addicted. <br> </p>

        <p>Looking back its easy to see the way that climbing has changed me:
            <ul>
               <li>Its made me a physically and mentally stronger individual</li> 
               <li>It's introduced me to like-minded friends</li>
               <li>It's brought me to places I never would have been to otherwise</li>
            </ul>
            All things I'm incredibly grateful for. Someday I would like to be able to climb the walls in Yosemite National Park. Many people consider that place to be the best spot in the world for climbing and its easy to see why.
